# This file contains globbing patterns that will be excluded from the nightly,
# automated backups. Patterns should be relative to $HOME listed one per line.
#
# These patterns can contain *, **, ?, and [...] (character ranges). As in
# a normal shell, * can be expanded to any string of characters not containing
# "/", ?  expands to any character except "/", and [...]  expands to a single
# character of those characters specified (ranges are acceptable).  The new
# special pattern, **, expands to any string of characters whether or not it
# contains "/".  Furthermore, if the pattern starts with "ignorecase:" (case
# insensitive), then this prefix will be removed and any character in the string
# can be replaced with an upper- or lowercase version of itself.
#
# The exclude pattern option matches a file if:
#
# 1.  pattern can be expanded into the file's filename, or
# 2.  the file is inside a directory matched by the option.
#
# For example,
#
#   /usr/local
#
# matches e.g. /usr/local, /usr/local/lib, and /usr/local/lib/netscape.
#
# See also the FILE SELECTION section in `man 1 duplicity` for patterns that
# can be used in a file pointed to by the argument of the
# --exclude-filelist flag.

# Exclude application caches.

# Exclude potentially large error logs.
